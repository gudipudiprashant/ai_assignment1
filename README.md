## Feature Selection using Wrapper Method
The python implementation of feature selection using Genetic Algorithm and Simulated annealing

### Dependencies
1. SciKit-learn
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib

### Clone and Run
```bash
>>> git clone https://github.com/gudipudiprashant/ai_assignment1
>>> cd ai_assignment1
>>> python3 test.py
```

The file config.py contains the hyperparameters for both the algorithms, which can be adjusted.

**Note:** The hyperparameters are tuned for the best performace with the current dataset `train_house_price.csv` and may not perform optimally on other datasets.
